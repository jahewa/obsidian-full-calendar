# Event Basics

An event can have a time in the calendar or last all day, and can also either happen at a single time or recur on a simple schedule.

## Create via event modal

Use the "Create event" command to bring up the event modal to add a new event of any type. You can also edit existing events through the modal by clicking on them!

## Create a timed, single-occurrance event via click-and-drag

Just click-and-drag on the calendar to create an event. The modal will pop up where you can fill in the details and tweak the timing.
