# Remote calendars in .ics format

Add any calendar that you have a link to in .ics format to Obsidian. This includes public calendars like [this one of US holidays](https://www.officeholidays.com/subscribe/usa), but also includes [private Google Calendars](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37648?hl=en#zippy=%2Csync-your-google-calendar-view-edit%2Cget-your-calendar-view-only%2Csecret-address) and [public Apple Calendars](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/share-a-calendar-mm6b1a9479/icloud). The walkthrough below shows where to find a Google Calendar's private .ics link, and how to add it to Obsidian, but any URL will work just as well.

Calendars are re-fetched automatically from their source at most every five minutes. If you would like to revalidate remote calendars directly, you can run the command `Full Calendar: Revalidate remote calendars`.
